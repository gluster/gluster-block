Installation Instructions:
-------------------------


Install from Source:
-------------------

# git clone https://github.com/gluster/gluster-block.git
# cd gluster-block/
# dnf install gcc autoconf automake make file libtool libuuid-devel json-c-devel \
              glusterfs-api-devel glusterfs-server targetcli tcmu-runner

On Fedora27 and Centos7 [Which use legacy glibc RPC], pass '--enable-tirpc=no'
# ./autogen.sh && ./configure --enable-tirpc=no && make -j install

On Fedora28 and higher [Which use TIRPC], in addition to above, we should also install
# dnf install rpcgen libtirpc-devel

And pass '--enable-tirpc=yes'(default) flag or nothing at configure time
# ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make -j install

Installation completed :-)

Check,
# gluster-block version
# gluster-block help

Make sure your version is the latest from the release, and the one you just installed.

Note: targetcli (>= 2.1.fb49) and tcmu-runner are runtime dependencies for gluster-block.
So, make sure you have them installed before starting gluster-blockd.
